We conducted an extensive analysis of the avocado market using a comprehensive dataset containing details such as date, average price, total volume sold, type, and region. Our project aimed to answer key questions about the market, including identifying regions with the highest and lowest avocado prices and demand, understanding average volumes, and predicting future prices using various parameters.

Our data analysis revealed that HartfordSpringfield, San Francisco, and New York are among the regions with the highest avocado prices, while Houston and DallasFtWorth are among the lowest. We also found that conventional avocados are cheaper and in higher demand compared to organic avocados. Using linear regression, we accurately predicted avocado prices based on the provided dataset, helping to inform better decision-making in the avocado market.

This project highlights the power of data analysis in understanding market trends and making informed business decisions.We conducted an extensive analysis of the avocado market using a comprehensive dataset containing details such as date, average price, total volume sold, type, and region.
